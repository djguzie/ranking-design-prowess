This is a self assement on my strengths and weaknesses for the Design Process steps.

##Discovery Phase - Experience: Medium
During my rotation with the Business team at my Apple store, I learned about the Briefings we conduct with new Business customers. Briefings allowed us to get a gauge on what the client wanted to do- and what was currently stopping them from doing so. I feel comfortable asking questions and have no hangups about getting clear on what I feel is the MOST important issue at hand- what problem clients want to solve.

##Strategy Phase - Experience: Low
Using my example of the Business team, after our Briefing was conducted most of the research fell on the Business team and I had little involvment except the knowledge I already had about what the competition was doing. I don't know in what format I would deliver any reserach analysis or to what website would give me statistics for who is doing what, and where I can find reliable sources. Very green to this stuff. From your introdcutory email it looks like I may be asking friends to help with this part. This could possibly test the strength of my friendships!

##INformation Architecture - Experience: Low
Currently I am in the process of wireframing and planning a site for a friend. He has committed to the coding side and I am currently in charge of what the different pages of the website will look like. But I am way behind and don't really know how to use Affinity Designer so I am behind the 8-ball on this. It would be great to get some experience so I can feel confident delivering things I can be proud of.

##Visual Design Phase - Experience: Low
Little to no experience here. By far one of my greatest weaknesses of the Design Processes. A friend did reccomend i think it was Adobe Color to have color pallettes for designing things.

##Development Phase - Experience Low
Even though I have some exepiernece in HTML, I don't know enough to code a website. To be honest, I've never tried. I am confident that when I am motivated enough to accomplish my goal, I succeed, so for me it's just a matter of time. I can hyperlink something in HTML no problem though.

##Launch Phase - Experience Low
Very little experience here. I'm noticing a pattern here and it seems that iterating is a HUGE part of the Design Process. I am excited for the opportunity to learn how to do this and to bug everyone I know to give me opinions on what they think.
